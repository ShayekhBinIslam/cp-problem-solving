Solved Problem for Competitive Programming on Different OJs

# Tips
Firstly strong theoretical concept regarding algorithms and when to apply a particular algorithm and then start coding from medium level to higher level  from different platforms. At least try to solve 20-25 questions daily. 

Firstly write your brute force solution and then try to optimize it as much as u can. Try to write your code on pen and paper rather than using ide and do run test cases by your own on copy, in this way to can understand each segment of code and also able to explain to the interviewer how it all goes. Goes from medium to high level rather than jumping directly. This is all you can do at the time of preparation.
